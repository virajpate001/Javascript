- A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
- With functions you can reuse code. 
- You can use the same code with different arguments, to produce different results.
-  local variables are only recognized inside their functions

1) Syntax :
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}

2) Function Return
- JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
- The return value is "returned" back to the "caller"
