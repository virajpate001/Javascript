- Modules help organize code by breaking it into smaller, manageable pieces, making it easier to understand, maintain, and reuse. 
- JavaScript introduced built-in support for modules through the "import" and "export" keywords.

A) How to work with Modules ? 
 - Create "file1.js" file & "file2.js"

 a) file1.js code
    export let name = "Viraj"; // variable 

    export function hello{} // function 

    export class user{} // class 

 b) file2.js code
    import {name, hello, user} from './file1.js'

    console.log(name) // print variable 

    hello();

    let a = new user();
