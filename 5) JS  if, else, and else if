Conditional Statements:
- when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:
a) Use "if" to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
b) Use "else" to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
c) Use "else if" to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
d) Use "switch" to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed. 

e.g.
if (time < 10) {
  greeting = "Good morning";
} else if (time < 20) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
