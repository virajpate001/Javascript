The spread operator (...) in JavaScript is a "feature" that allows you to spread elements
of an iterable (like an array or a string) into individual elements.

- spread operator se "array" or "string" ki values ko alag alag karta he.

1) Expanding Arrays:
- You can use the spread operator to expand elements of one array into another.
example: 
let x = ["Viraj", "Aditya", "Ashu", "Sanmay"];
let y = [...x, "Karan", "Sahil"];
console.log(y);

2) Copying Arrays:
- The spread operator is used to create a shallow copy of an array.
let x = ["Viraj", "Aditya", "Ashu", "Sanmay"];
let y = [...x];
console.log(y);

3) Passing Function Arguments:
- It can be used to pass elements of an array as arguments to a function:
     let x = [10, 20 ,50, 60];
     function main(a,b,c,d){
       return a+b+c+d;
     }
    document.write(`${main(...x)}`);

4) Concatenating Arrays:
- You can use the spread operator to concatenate arrays:
exapmle: 
     let x = [12,32,45,50];
     let y = [20.50,45,56];
     let z = [...x, ...y];
     document.write(z);
