- The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.


Syntax:
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
 increment/decrement
}

Example 1) I Want print my name 5 times

let name = "Viraj";
console.log(name);
console.log(name);
console.log(name);
console.log(name);
console.log(name);

Example 2) With While loop 
let name = "Viraj";
let i = 0;
while(i < 5){
document.write(`${name} <br>`);
  i++;
}
