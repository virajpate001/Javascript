- Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.
- if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
- The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:

Syntax :
for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}

Expression 1 :  is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
             - You can initiate many values in expression 1 (separated by comma):

Expression 2 : defines the condition for executing the code block.
             - If expression 2 returns true, the loop will start over again. If it returns false, the loop will end.

Expression 3 : is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
             - Often expression 3 increments the value of the initial variable.

Example 1) Without Loop 

 const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford", "Fiat", "Audi"];

    console.log(cars[0]);
    console.log(cars[1]);
    console.log(cars[2]);
    console.log(cars[3]);
    console.log(cars[4]);
    console.log(cars[5]);

Example 2) With Loop

const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford", "Fiat", "Audi"];

for(let i = 0; i < cars.length ; i++){
       console.log(cars[i]);
    }
