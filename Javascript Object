Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

1) Example :  
let person = {  
     firstName: "Viraj", 
     lastName:"Pate",
     age:21,
     dboYear:1998,
   };


2) Object Properties:
-> name:values


3) How to assign Object Properties:
-> person.firstName;
or 
-> person["lastName"];


4) How to display all Object Properties:
-> use "for in" loop 
-> Exmple: 
   for(let key in person){
     document.write(key + ": " + person[key] + "<br>");
   }

5) Objects can also have methods(Functions).
->  example:
   let person = {
     firstName: "Viraj", 
     lastName:"Pate",
     age:21,
     dboYear:1998,
     fullName: function(){
       return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
     }
   };

  document.write(person.fullName()); 



Note: "This" Keword
1) In an object method, this refers to the object.
2) Alone, this refers to the global object.
3) In a function, this refers to the global object.
4) In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
5) In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
6) Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.
