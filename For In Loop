The JavaScript for in statement loops through the properties of an Object:

Syntax: 

for (key in object) {
  // code block to be executed
}

Example 1) Without For in loop
let person = {fname:"Viraj", lname:"Pate", age:25};
console.log(person.fname);
console.log(person.lname);
console.log(person.age);


Example 2) With For in loop
let person = {fname:"Viraj", lname:"Pate", age:25};
for(let key in person){
   console.log(`${key} : ${person[key]} `);
  }
