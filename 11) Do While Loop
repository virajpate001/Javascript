- The do while loop is a variant of the while loop.
- This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

Syntax :
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);

Example : 
let name = "Viraj";
let i = 0;

do{
     document.write(`${name} <br>`);
       i++;
  }
 while(i < 5);
